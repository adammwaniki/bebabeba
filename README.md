Bebabeba - Microfinance meets Microservices

Bebabeba, (pronounced / bay-buh-bay-buh /), is a Kenyan Swahili slang word used by matatu touts meaning "carry" that serves as an energetic call for commuters to hop on board.

In the same spirit, Bebabeba is a platform built to carry _people_, _goods_, and _opportunities_.

This monorepo is the official home of the Bebabeba platform, uniting transport, logistics, and financial services under one ecosystem.

## Our Mission - The 3 Tenets

We believe in empowering communities through three core pillars:

1. Financial services

    - Mobilizing member savings and providing affordable credit to fuel personal growth, business expansion, and community advancement. Members benefit from low-interest loans, flexible repayment, and collective ownership.

2. Logistics

    - Streamlining the movement of goods, from bulk supplies to last-mile delivery, helping members and businesses reach their customers reliably and affordably.

3. Public transport
    - Operating a network of public service vehicles that ensures safe, affordable travel while enabling members to thrive through vehicle ownership and route management.
